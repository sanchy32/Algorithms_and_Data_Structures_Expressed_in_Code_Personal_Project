# Algorithms_and_Data_Structures_Expressed_in_Code_Personal_Project
This is a personal project in progress involving expressing learned concepts through classes on the subject and personal work on code using primarily C/C++, Java, and Python.
The aim is to write code that exemplify the algorithms and data structures in question similar to how they can be contructed in prcatice which still being somewhat easy to process with the intention of working from simple concepts to potentially more complex.
